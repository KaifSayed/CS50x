Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

While running 10 simulations or any small number of simulations the output are random,
for example the team Spain got a 50% chance of winning but the next time only got 10%.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

While running 10000 simulations or higher, the output always favour Belgium with 21.2% chance of winning,
followed up by Brazil with 20.7%. Thus running 10000 simulations shows the same and stabilized result,
so I'd consider 10000 to be good enough.
