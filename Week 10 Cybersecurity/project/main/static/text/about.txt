 I'm a 18 year old programmer based in Mumbai, India.

    I'm currently studying Bachelor of Computer Application in Mumbai.
It is a IT course provided by Maharashtra University, but I have been
interested in coding way before high school.

    My favorite part of coding were always been game development and
those I started learning on Unity with C#. It waschallenging but with
the help of YouTube and made some games. The starting games were not
all that special so I try making more hard games and for that I got
introduce with A.I. mainly for making enemy AI and with that my real
coding journey started.

   I'm currently seeking new opportunities to further my growth and
learn more about software engineering, artificial intelligence and
game development.

   Please feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to known more.
